What I learned today: If you are using uglifyjs, by default it compresses all unicode characters to UTF-8.

This can have a variety of unexpected side-effects, but in my case I had a regular expression that was searching for certain emoji ðŸ˜ƒand it worked correctly in development mode, but as soon as I compiled for production, it stopped working.

The solution is to set the `output` option `ascii_only` to `true`. This is [right there in the documentation](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2) but is easy to miss if youâ€™re working on a big app with lots of moving parts, throw in a regular expression, and then get stumped when it stops working once you deploy to a test environment.
