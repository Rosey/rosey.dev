While it was difficult to shoot him through glass, I was able to get a good shot when he crawled between two rocks and looked me right in the eye.","photo_id":"9669623003"},"next":{"id":"c30c1978-8841-59bd-909f-f86ecceb4f96"}},{"node":{"id":"c30c1978-8841-59bd-909f-f86ecceb4f96","title":"The Angel Tree","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/7295/9664552666_882c8cc6da.jpg","description":"A &quot;must see&quot; if you are near Charleston is the Angel Tree on John's Island.  I could have spent hours here, but we were quite limited on time.  The poles you see on the left side of the tree are supports for some of the larger limbs.  No doubt, the neatest tree I have seen.","photo_id":"9664552666"},"next":{"id":"93fe45f4-53b2-59d3-affd-40933f57b61a"}},{"node":{"id":"93fe45f4-53b2-59d3-affd-40933f57b61a","title":"Naturally Framed","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/2891/9626580701_261174804a.jpg","description":"This is a sunrise at Folly Beach from the inlet.

The live oaks go on like this for over a mile, but the area in this shot is probably where they are the most dense.  The history of the Plantation is quite harsh as much cruelty is reported to have gone on here during the slave trade. Remarkably, the Plantation is now a DNR management area that houses some of the most beautiful settings in the low country.","photo_id":"9622553148"},"next":{"id":"ed1be1c9-d174-5462-92a0-63eec5173c37"}},{"node":{"id":"ed1be1c9-d174-5462-92a0-63eec5173c37","title":"Luxurious Sunrise at Sullivan's Island","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/2857/9612307951_cd11e37fb5.jpg","description":"It was a fairly plain morning for a sunrise, but I couldn't help shoot this unique house at the inlet.","photo_id":"9612307951"},"next":{"id":"a610860a-7660-50ef-8f55-25eecaf126b5"}},{"node":{"id":"a610860a-7660-50ef-8f55-25eecaf126b5","title":"Weathered","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/3750/9607898394_20b16010a0.jpg","description":"One of the really neat places around Charleston, SC is the boneyard beach at Botany Bay Plantation on Edisto Island.  Visitors are not permitted to remove any shells or artifacts.  As you can imagine, the beach (and trees) are lined with all kinds of treasures.  This small conch and oak caught my eye.","photo_id":"9607898394"},"next":{"id":"79c1f6cd-07d1-5f7d-ad6d-3587b9320d87"}},{"node":{"id":"79c1f6cd-07d1-5f7d-ad6d-3587b9320d87","title":"Traversing the Low Country","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/5540/9596819887_4158a15269.jpg","description":"This is the Arthur Ravenel, Jr. Bridge between Charleston and Mt.
