The glacier is approximately 3.7 miles long and an estimated 300-980 ft. thick depending on the area and season.  In past years the glacier covered the area where I took this photo.  One of the highlights of our trip was being able to walk on the glacier and bring back two bottles of glacier water.  When we returned we enjoyed a picnic at one of the lakes below with some sandwiches and ice cold glacier water.\n\nI took about 100 shots of the mountain and glacier, but was most pleased with this B&amp;W version, which really brought out the detail in the ice.\n\nPlease view on black by typing &quot;L.&quot;","photo_id":"7850514030"},"next":{"id":"5ce2d08c-6a45-5fed-948a-991b60452197"}},{"node":{"id":"5ce2d08c-6a45-5fed-948a-991b60452197","title":"Tangle Falls","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/8433/7837807600_3c4d947a08.jpg","description":"The upper section of Tangle Falls along the Icefield Parkway in Alberta.

I dont think anyone but my wife saw her.  Thankfully she nudged me and I slowly began to take shots and follow the doe into the woods.  This deer was quite trusting and allowed me to get within about 3 feet at one point.  In the rush to get some shots, I was slow to adjust my ISO settings for the dark forest.  Thankfully this one came out.","photo_id":"7745890676"},"next":{"id":"186dd831-bb0c-54b6-81dd-dc3a863ca2ec"}},{"node":{"id":"186dd831-bb0c-54b6-81dd-dc3a863ca2ec","title":"Athabasca Falls","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/8281/7732472384_aba441b3c1.jpg","description":"Athabasca Falls is just South of Jasper, Alberta along the Icefield Parkway.
