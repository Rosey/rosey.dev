Among the moss, water, trees, etc. there are probably at least 10 differernt shades of green that are visible.  The sun was just starting to lift through the clouds at this point, but I was still able to take a long exposure from below the splash pool.  \n\nExplore #35, February 3, 2012","photo_id":"6811622287"},"next":{"id":"baf3ad30-2db8-5769-85dd-8955106685fd"}},{"node":{"id":"baf3ad30-2db8-5769-85dd-8955106685fd","title":"Be Still","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/7006/6801097775_29b9a2cde5.jpg","description":"I usually prefer not to shoot the &quot;head-on&quot; shot, but this one seemed to work for me with the light coming in in the upper right hand corner.
