When I hiked up the Chinabee Silent Trail a few weeks ago- it finally was.  The only problem was that the pool in front was loaded with trash and debris.  After &quot;working for the shot&quot; I was able to get several pretty good ones.","photo_id":"5975708457"},"next":{"id":"30ddaa20-f8c5-5cd5-a622-11b8fc748af8"}},{"node":{"id":"30ddaa20-f8c5-5cd5-a622-11b8fc748af8","title":"Curves","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/6133/5972012103_836c3d0de9.jpg","description":"The curve of this current running through the stream provides a nice path over the sunlit rocky bottom.

For this shot I balanced along the edge of another fall and placed my tripod beneath an overhanging rock.  Still not sure it was worth it, but my wife seemed to like the shot.
