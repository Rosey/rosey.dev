On our way in we stopped at Soco Falls.  I had not really been pleased with any shots I had from there and had a few new comps in mind.  Thankfully the conditions were right and I was able to scramble down to the base of the falls and somehow avoid soaking my camera and myself.  After shooting for nearly 30 minutes in the same spot and fighting water droplets on the camera, this was the payoff.","photo_id":"8118810399"},"next":{"id":"39920162-cf73-51a4-8a14-20e4a83108e8"}},{"node":{"id":"39920162-cf73-51a4-8a14-20e4a83108e8","title":"Coldwater Bridge","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/8323/8102493758_550d1ce359.jpg","description":"Coldwater Bridge at Oxford Lake at sunrise.","photo_id":"8102493758"},"next":{"id":"c3748df4-57ad-5780-a535-a8f7feb85213"}},{"node":{"id":"c3748df4-57ad-5780-a535-a8f7feb85213","title":"Richardson's Ground Squirrel","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/8044/8093553568_98c8d802dc.jpg","description":"These little critters were all over Alberta, but were new and fascinating to me.

I'm not sure whether it is a mature ewe or a young male, but the horns are impressive nonetheless.  Have a great weekend everyone!

I had seen similar shots online but none which fully showed all of the mushroom rock/ship in the middle of the creek.  Unfortunately nature did not cooperate and the weather was extremely too sunny for shooting waterfalls.  I tried to make the most of it with a wide angle lens and HDR.  The one nice aspect of all the sun was the  rays coming down through the forest.  I've got some other comps (and a B&amp;W) which I'll be interested to get thoughts on as well.  Thanks for viewing.
