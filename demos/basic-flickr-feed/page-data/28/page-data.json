Years before as a young boy, Worcester had visited Arlington National Cemetery in our nationâ€™s capitol. The experience had reminded him through his life of the sacrifice some had made in order for others, including himself, to succeed and flourish.\n\nPlans were made to lay the wreaths in honor of our Veterans at an older, less visited section of Arlington National Cemetery. Volunteers stepped forward to help deliver and place the wreaths.\n\nIn 2007, the Wreaths Across America non-profit group was founded. The event has expanded to all 50 states to lay wreaths at veterans cemeteries to remember our fallen heroes, honor those who serve and teach our children about the sacrifices made by veterans and their families.\n\nWreaths Across America traditionally lays wreaths on the second Saturday in December.  Beginning in 2016, wreaths were laid on the third Saturday in December.","photo_id":"31627477221"},"next":{"id":"072cc493-f19d-52d8-b03a-adaf0cb0c651"}},{"node":{"id":"072cc493-f19d-52d8-b03a-adaf0cb0c651","title":"Great Blue Heron","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/531/31606119541_146090ac5e.jpg","description":"","photo_id":"31606119541"},"next":{"id":"e955ec7d-15cd-5590-8514-f5c3861903cc"}},{"node":{"id":"e955ec7d-15cd-5590-8514-f5c3861903cc","title":"Blending In","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/738/31307871810_a80f855905.jpg","description":"","photo_id":"31307871810"},"next":{"id":"70a78e4e-0d09-5393-a747-8d5d3f5c52b2"}},{"node":{"id":"70a78e4e-0d09-5393-a747-8d5d3f5c52b2","title":"Standing Tall","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/694/31450876132_db858704db.jpg","description":"","photo_id":"31450876132"},"next":{"id":"63d92faf-c7b0-570c-a6fc-b87cabc8e6e1"}},{"node":{"id":"63d92faf-c7b0-570c-a6fc-b87cabc8e6e1","title":"Lucky #7","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/565/31584759815_8c6cbc911f.jpg","description":"","photo_id":"31584759815"},"next":{"id":"f9fd9d85-0006-5c4f-94eb-e6e501d6cab4"}},{"node":{"id":"f9fd9d85-0006-5c4f-94eb-e6e501d6cab4","title":"Searching","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/656/31391328451_f7bacf5159.jpg","description":"","photo_id":"31391328451"},"next":{"id":"4dff28fd-063b-50ff-865d-44280948387d"}},{"node":{"id":"4dff28fd-063b-50ff-865d-44280948387d","title":"Bella","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/5514/31445913756_98d1a1306c.jpg","description":"","photo_id":"31445913756"},"next":{"id":"cde87b99-af2b-5cf9-9261-1aef46c1958a"}},{"node":{"id":"cde87b99-af2b-5cf9-9261-1aef46c1958a","title":"Buck in Frost","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/5580/31344560681_86b1b83291.jpg","description":"","photo_id":"31344560681"},"next":null}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":10,"skip":270,"numPages":90,"currentPage":28}}}
