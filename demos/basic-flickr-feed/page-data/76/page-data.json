We had gone over to Lake Louise for dinner and to shoot around the lake when a huge storm blew through.  My choices were limited.

It didn't disappoint.  This scene is fairly similar to the image on the Canadian 20 dollar bill in 1969 and 1979.","photo_id":"7949032712"},"next":{"id":"fef5898b-c50b-5c94-bb92-5f3cf3235624"}},{"node":{"id":"fef5898b-c50b-5c94-bb92-5f3cf3235624","title":"Mouthfull","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/8318/7933315522_b985fa4d58.jpg","description":"Took this with my friend Brody J on a photo shoot of Bon Secour Refuge several weeks ago.

Frankly, I'm not great at it, but I try.  This is my attempt at a unique shot of Moraine Lake and the Valley of the Ten Peaks at sunset.  The rock pile in the left of the scene is the famous rock pile where most of the Moraine Lake shots have been taken.  That shot and some others are on their way....","photo_id":"7899777202"},"next":{"id":"0e6ff492-8b28-5430-ab74-2b72daa37c45"}},{"node":{"id":"0e6ff492-8b28-5430-ab74-2b72daa37c45","title":"Moraine Lake Logs","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/8459/7886860196_413f48d54b.jpg","description":"One of the great things about Canada is all the natural wood fireplaces.
