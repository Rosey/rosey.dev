I finally had the opportunity to shoot this barred owl at Cades Cove last week. Little did I know it would allow me (and others) to approach within 15 yards! What an awe-inspiring experience. More shots of the National Park to come.","photo_id":"18854739402"},"next":{"id":"29b1625b-ce3c-5b9b-b7ec-2f4aaaf7bcc4"}},{"node":{"id":"29b1625b-ce3c-5b9b-b7ec-2f4aaaf7bcc4","title":"Farm on Fire","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/326/18540650982_bb14a94756.jpg","description":"I hated not to have my good camera for such a great sunrise this AM.

The sunrise conditions were not ideal (cloudy and rain) but I was nonetheless taken in by the beauty of the place.  The Cahaba lilies (or Shoal lilies) bloom between mid May and mid June each year.  If you live in AL and have not had a chance to view this awesome wonder, do yourself a favor!  I will definitely be back.","photo_id":"17630780400"},"next":{"id":"7f1885a1-0a2e-59c1-be9e-ca0c0755f585"}},{"node":{"id":"7f1885a1-0a2e-59c1-be9e-ca0c0755f585","title":"Foggy, Starry Night","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/7759/16899951353_d284301f3f.jpg","description":"Blue Ridge Star Park\nBurnsville, NC","photo_id":"16899951353"},"next":{"id":"debdea52-5463-568e-baab-e27836fd4a62"}},{"node":{"id":"debdea52-5463-568e-baab-e27836fd4a62","title":"Hunting Hens","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/7743/17159523797_d8ffa2db3c.jpg","description":"","photo_id":"17159523797"},"next":{"id":"9ad36393-1067-53a8-9457-6b59f91895ca"}},{"node":{"id":"9ad36393-1067-53a8-9457-6b59f91895ca","title":"Ole Tom","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/7724/16613818543_39e3f206dc.jpg","description":"Turkey in the Mountain Longleaf National Wildlife Refuge","photo_id":"16613818543"},"next":{"id":"cfc33b9f-0f81-5aad-9de5-f34f3ab87553"}},{"node":{"id":"cfc33b9f-0f81-5aad-9de5-f34f3ab87553","title":"Sharp","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/8771/17166363001_cea7e41e04.jpg","description":"Yucca Plant","photo_id":"17166363001"},"next":{"id":"f44624f8-8e9d-5642-b1bb-167c41c9f4f0"}},{"node":{"id":"f44624f8-8e9d-5642-b1bb-167c41c9f4f0","title":"Looking Up","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/8735/17096657542_479558c087.jpg","description":"Mandrill @ The Birmingham Zoo","photo_id":"17096657542"},"next":null}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":10,"skip":400,"numPages":90,"currentPage":41}}}
