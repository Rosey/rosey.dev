Herons can stay incredibly still, usually, but I had trouble getting a long exposure without movement.

The ship was exposed briefly in past hurricanes, but exposed to a greater extent in Hurricane Ike in 2008 and then tropical storm Ida in 2009.  There are many theories on the name and origin of the ship.  Some believe it could be an old Civil War era ship, the Monticello or a rum runner, the Aurora.  Most likely, the ship is the Rachael, an early 1900s schooner that ran aground in 1933.  \n\nTheories and identifications aside, it's a treasure to behold and is being reburied by nature a little more every day.  If you venture off to see this landmark, please be respectful of the landowners nearby and the history of the ship itself.  While I did not see any &quot;poachers,&quot; I do understand that some folks have taken pieces of metal or wood off the ship as souvenirs.  Let's leave it for all to enjoy.","photo_id":"8253935203"},"next":{"id":"77002cb7-e060-5e03-b990-d3cf5c64315f"}},{"node":{"id":"77002cb7-e060-5e03-b990-d3cf5c64315f","title":"Cross Creek Lightshow","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/8206/8251516187_88b496ac65.jpg","description":"Autumn Sunset over Little Lagoon, Gulf Shores, AL.","photo_id":"8251516187"},"next":{"id":"ca275dc6-ddac-58a2-894a-7d32a9f94ce0"}},{"node":{"id":"ca275dc6-ddac-58a2-894a-7d32a9f94ce0","title":"Lagoon Sunset","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/8347/8248983073_12344406e7.jpg","description":"","photo_id":"8248983073"},"next":{"id":"a0a07f01-c6bd-509a-911c-50bdb3d78132"}},{"node":{"id":"a0a07f01-c6bd-509a-911c-50bdb3d78132","title":"Early Bird","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/8210/8247391422_0910366565.jpg","description":"A heron wades through Gator Lake looking for breakfast.","photo_id":"8247391422"},"next":{"id":"14422a1c-d8ce-5216-94ec-399c05c4ce51"}},{"node":{"id":"14422a1c-d8ce-5216-94ec-399c05c4ce51","title":"Isolation","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/8345/8243563631_bf10273fe4.jpg","description":"Lonely pier stretching into the fog on Bon Secour Bay--taken just before sunrise.","photo_id":"8243563631"},"next":{"id":"bdc5ac88-2b51-59c0-9f1c-becdb39e0b45"}},{"node":{"id":"bdc5ac88-2b51-59c0-9f1c-becdb39e0b45","title":"A Refuge","url_m":"https://live.staticflickr.com/8198/8241549520_684351e3f9.jpg","description":"Sunrise from the observation tower in the Bon Secour Refuge.
