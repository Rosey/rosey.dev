 <p>Hi. I am a developer. I feel like this site should be really cool to show off my developer skills but. It is not. Sorry.</p>
<h2>About me</h2>
<h3>Work</h3>
<ul>
<li>👩‍💻 <strong>Currently Engineering Lead</strong> at <a href="https://getflow.com" target="_blank">Flow</a>.

Previously at Flow: <strong>Web Team Lead</strong> and before that: <strong>Javascript Developer</strong>. I’ve been there since 2013 because the work is fun and they’re a great employer. I like writing and reviewing code most but it’s nice to have variety. Flow is a small enough team that I can do a bit of everything. “Engineering lead” is a formidable title, so I feel like I need to add a caveat: I’m not a terrible developer by any means but I have met many far more talented people than I.</li>
<li>🤓 Before Flow I was a <strong>JS Dev</strong> with <a href="https://getballpark.com" target="_blank">Ballpark</a>. I was the only Front End dev on that team and I was green af. It was fun though and I learned a lot and nothing caught on fire so all-in-all, it worked out great.</li>
<li>🖍 Before <em>that</em>, I did agency work for <a href="https://atomiccrayon.com" target="_blank">Atomic Crayon</a>. A bit of a mish mash of programming languages there, I don’t remember much of it 😅. I just remember my boss telling me, “Slow down and be careful,” so I guess I introduced a bug or two.</li>
<li>🎓 Got a diploma in “Computer Systems Technology.” it has been somewhat useful.</li>
<li>🐢 Grew up making personal websites in the late 90’s early 00’s. Angelfire, Greymatter, webrings and button boards… It was a glorious time to be alive.</li>
<li>🧠 Skill wise: I’m ok. Maybe even good! I have been promoted a few times, after all. Still, I’m definitely not the best in the field. I have met and worked with a lot of people who are about 100 times smarter than I am. I have done some dumb things and written some bad code. (And that is not just past tense, I am sure next year I will notice all the dumb things I did this year)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Not Work</h3>
<ul>
<li>🍼 Became a mom in 2018.</li>
<li>🐕 Became a dog mom in 2013.</li>
<li>👨‍💼 Got married in 2014 to Ben.</li>
<li>📚 Hobbies: Dog training, especially agility. Also: reading fiction. Sometimes doing dev stuff but I do so much of it at work that usually I need a break. Also I occasionally play Nintendo Switch.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Do you have a blog</h3>
<p>I love the idea of it but I have no confidence in my ability to write long smart sounding articles, so I ended up making a micro blog where I can just post tiny things. <a href="/blog">Check out my micro-blog &rightarrow;</a></p>
